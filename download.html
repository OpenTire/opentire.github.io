            <p>No stable versions of OpenTIRE have been released yet. You can however down the code base from the link below. You can also browse the code in the projects repository. </p>

            <p>OpenTIRE is a Python module, as such you will need to have a distribution of Python installed. OpenTIRE recommends the <a href="https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/">Anaconda Scientific Python</a> distribution which also packs many of the scientific libraries available for Python. OpenTIRE however works with any 2.7.x version of Python.</p>

            <p>If you are new to Python and are looking to easily get started,  <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/">JetBrains PyCharm Community Edition</a> software offers a user friendly interface, that is not very different from for example MATLAB. Another option is to use IPython Notebooks that are available within the Anaconda distribution.</p>
